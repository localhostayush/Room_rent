Project Description: Room Rent Service Web Application

The Room Rent Service project is a web application designed to provide users with an intuitive platform to browse and evaluate rental rooms. This project dynamically displays room information from an external dataset stored in a CSV file and incorporates interactive features for enhanced user experience.

Key Features:

Dynamic Room Listings:
Room details such as Room ID, Price, Location, and BHK are dynamically fetched and displayed from a CSV file.
Ensures flexibility and easy updates to the dataset without modifying the codebase.

Interactive Ratings:
Separate rating systems for Owner and Renter, allowing users to rate their experiences using visually appealing star ratings.
Modern Design:

A clean, user-friendly interface with smooth hover animations and responsive design for seamless navigation across devices.
Scalability:

Capable of handling large datasets, making it suitable for businesses managing hundreds or thousands of rental properties.
Separation of Concerns:

Data is externalized into a room_rent_dataset.csv file, simplifying the process of managing room information.
Technology Stack:
Frontend:

HTML5: For structuring the web page.
CSS3: For styling and responsive design.
JavaScript: For dynamic data rendering and interactivity.
Backend Integration (Future Scope):

Can be extended with a server-side technology (e.g., Node.js, Python Flask, or PHP) for real-time data fetching and user authentication.
Dataset Format:

Data is stored in a CSV file (room_rent_dataset.csv) with fields like Room ID, Price (USD), Location, and BHK.
Use Cases:
Users:

Browse available rooms and view detailed information.
Provide feedback by rating both owners and renters.
Property Managers:

Update the dataset to reflect new listings or changes in rental details.
Future Enhancements:
Search and Filter Options:

Allow users to search for rooms based on location, price range, or BHK.
User Authentication:

Implement login and registration for tenants and owners.
Database Integration:

Replace the CSV file with a database (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB) for better scalability and performance.
Booking Functionality:

Add options for tenants to reserve rooms directly through the platform.
Mobile-Friendly Design:

Optimize the layout and features for a smoother mobile experience.





Objective:
This project aims to simplify the room rental process by providing a centralized platform that combines dynamic data presentation, interactivity, and scalability. It serves as a foundation for building a full-fledged rental management system.
